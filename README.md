Project Description: The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to eat food 
and grow longer without colliding with the walls or its own tail. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible.

 - Implementation Language and Platform: The Snake Game is implemented in Python, utilizing the Pygame library. 
   Pygame provides a set of tools and functionalities for game development, making it suitable for creating 2D games like Snake.
 - Game Mechanics and Features: The game features a controllable snake that moves across the screen. 
   The snake can change direction based on user input (arrow keys). The player earns points by eating food items, 
   and the snake grows longer with each food item consumed. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
 - Game Design and Graphics: The game's graphical interface is designed using Pygame's functionality. 
   It includes visual elements such as a playing area, the snake, food items, and score display. 
   The design ensures clear visibility of the game objects and provides a user-friendly experience.
 - Customizability and Expandability: The project's structure and code allow for potential customization and expansion. 
   It is possible to modify game parameters such as speed, grid size, and visuals. 
   Additionally, the codebase provides a foundation for adding new features, power-ups, or different game modes in the future.
